Analogically, you will build the output layer and put hidden one as an input.

## Task 4

You need to come up with the dimensions of the weights and biases and create then as TensorFlow variables. Use the same initialisation methods as for the hidden layer. The output is the result of multiplication hidden and weights and then adding the bias.
