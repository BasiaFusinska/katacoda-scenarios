In the previous scenarios, you've learned the central concepts of the Machine Learning process and created few layer for the neural network architecture. The network didn't perform well because we didn't apply any training yet.

In this scenario, we will do the walkthrough of the Deep Learning process. We will start from loading the data and building the layers. Then we'll use forward- and backpropagation in the training process.
