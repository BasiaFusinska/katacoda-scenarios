The next step is to set up the loss function. This will become the [function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss_functions_for_classification) we are going to optimise in the process.

We will use the [cross-entropy loss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross_entropy) which equation can be set up as follows:

You can find the implementation in the helper.py file as `cost` function.
