Let's build our first Deep Learning process. We will use the flower shaped dataset to accomplish this task. As we said, the data is not linearly separable. This means that algorithms that rely on the straight lines to separate classes won't be of much help.

When building a neural network for the case like this, it means we need to introduce hidden layers. The final architecture looks like the one in the image.

In the next steps we will load the data, build the network and train it to make future predictions.
