Deep Learning (DL) is the set of techniques that work especially well with computer vision and natural language processing tasks. DL is the part of a broader area called Machine Learning (ML) that in its classical form address problems like classification, regression or clustering.

This scenario is the first one in the 'Deep Learning with TensorFlow' cycle. It doesn't refer to TensorFlow yet, but instead, aims at introducing the concepts of ML and describing the classification problem.

To take the most of this course, you should know how to program in Python or another language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
