In the last scenario, we created a simple one layered neural network. The goal of the current one is to add at least one another layer. We will continue to work with _fully connected_ NNs.

The architecture you're supposed to build looks like the one on the image below.

As you may have noticed, we added here additional layer. If it's placed between the input and output, it's called [hidden layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network). Hidden layers are the components that make neural networks _deep_.
