If you open the `forward_propagation.py`{{open}} you can see the code that is loading and printing the data. We have also implemented `output_layer_fp` function that is performing the _forward propagation_ for the _output layer_. This was your task in the previous scenario.

The function is using `numpy` `matmul` function to perform matrix multiplication. As an activation, we used sigmoid provided in the `helper.py` script.

You will use this function further when building the whole network architecture and performing forward propagation to predict the labels.
