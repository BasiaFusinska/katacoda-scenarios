The output of the first convolutional layer is of a shape that can be directly fed into the second one. Your task here is to set up the next convolutional layer.

# Task 4

For this step, you need to write the code for:

* set up weights variable to represent the filter
* define the bias variable
* connect the first convolutional layer with the second one
* add bias and wrap it up with the reLU function
* set up the max-pooling layer
