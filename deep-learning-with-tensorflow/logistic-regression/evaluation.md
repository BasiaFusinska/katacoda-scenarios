The last phase is the evaluation of the model performance. You will get the _predictions_ from the trained models and compare them with the correct labels. This is how the accuracy is going to be calculated.

Your task now is to generate the predictions from every trained model. To accomplish it, you may simply use [predict](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegressionCV.predict) function. Once we have predictions generated by our models, we can calculate the accuracy using `accuracy_score` from the `sklearn` package. The last few lines are creating the decision boundaries for all three models.

When your code is ready, run the script using the following command:
`python classification.py`{{execute}}

You probably have noticed that no matter the split, models are not doing a very good job and are no better than random guessing. This happens because we are using linear models to separate non-linear data. Other classification algorithms would fix this, but in the rest of the course we will focus on the specific one - _neural networks_ and _deep learning_ to address this issue.
