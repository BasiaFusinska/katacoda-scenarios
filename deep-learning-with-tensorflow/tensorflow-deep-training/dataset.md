In the last scenario, we've built a simple neural network, with just one output layer. As we know this is not sufficient when working with the non linearly separated data.

The network will need the hidden layer, so the architecture will look as follows:

You will be writing the code in the `neural_network.py`{{open}} file. Specific tasks have been marked. As you can see we have loaded the data for you and set up some variables for the further process.
