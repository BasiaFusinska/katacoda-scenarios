This scenario is our first attempt to build one of the building blocks for the Deep Learning process. We will be using numpy library that is one of the most commonly used ones when working with arrays, vectors and tensors. It allows vectorising most of the operations making the computations more efficient.

In the next steps, you will build the simple classifying neural network and Forward Propagation flow. This is the first step when creating Deep Learning models.
