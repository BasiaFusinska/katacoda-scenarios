
The first step when applying forward propagation is to _aggregate the multiplication results of the input data and weights_. Then the _bias_ is added.

##Task 2

Your task here is to implement matrix multiplication for the output layer. This will be wrapped in a `forward_propagation` function. You should use [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/) library as the function may be called with the array of values, not just a single record. You may find functions like `dot` or `matmul` helpful.

Be careful when working with dimensions, because mistakes can cause Python errors.
