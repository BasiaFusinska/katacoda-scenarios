Both vectors and lists can have named elements. To illustrate it you can create and display a vector using names:

`myVector <- c(a=1, b=2, c=3)
myVector`{{execute}}

The same is also available for the list:

`myList <- list(a="a", b="b", c="c")
myList`{{execute}}

With named elements vector's elements have proper headers. When using names on elements of the list no double brackets are shown, there are names after the sign `$` shown.
