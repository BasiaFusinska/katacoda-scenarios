TensorFlow is the platform enabling building deep Neural Network architectures and performing Deep Learning. Natural Language Processing is the class of problems of using and processing text. This tutorial introduces the basics needed to perform text generation.

In this scenario, you will learn how to use TensorFlow and Keras for text generation. The content is based on the official [Text generation tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/sequences/text_generation).

To take the most of this course, you should know how to program in Python or other languages that would allow you to understand Python syntax. Knowledge on TensorFlow is also valuable.
