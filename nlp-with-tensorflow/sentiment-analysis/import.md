To start working with Python shell run the following command:

`python3`{{execute}}

You can use `quit()` to leave it.

To start working you should first import few packages to give Python access to all its assets:

`import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
import os
import pandas as pd
import tensorflow_hub as tf_hub`{{execute}}

Some of the helper functions has been defined in the `help` package. The package contains mostly functions to load the data.

`import help`{{execute}}
