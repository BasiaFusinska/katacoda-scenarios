Like many other languages, R has a variety of basic types and more complex types that can be created from the 'atomic' ones. Basic types in R are:

* numeric (real)
* integer
* character
* logical
* complex

Because R is a dynamically typed language you are able to convert variables values from one type to the other.
This scenario introduces mechanisms of conversions in R.
