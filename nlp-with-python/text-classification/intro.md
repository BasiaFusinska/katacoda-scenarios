Natural Language Processing aggregates several tasks that can be performed, like:

* Part of speech tagging
* Word segmentation
* Named entity recognition
* Machine translation
* Question answering
* Sentiment analysis
* Topic segmentation and recognition
* Natural language generation

One of them is classifying the text based on the content. In this scenario you will learn how to use *Bag of Words* and *td-idf* models to perform the task.
