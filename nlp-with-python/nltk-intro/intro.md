Natural Language Processing aggregates several tasks that can be performed, like:

* Part of speech tagging
* Word segmentation
* Named entity recognition
* Machine translation
* Question answering
* Sentiment analysis
* Topic segmentation and recognition
* Natural language generation

It all starts though with preparing text for further processing. In this lab you will learn how to use some of the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) capabilities to clean and prepare text data.
