As we want our vocabulary to contain only "real" words, you should get rid of the words that are numbers, punctuations, etc. One way to do it is to use `isalpha` function, another is to use regular expressions.

# Task

Use your preferred way to remove non-words from our vocabulary (`words` variable).

Once done this line should return the vocabulary with only alphabetical characters.
