TensorFlow is the platform enabling building deep Neural Network architectures and performing Deep Learning. This tutorial introduces the basics needed to create more complex structures.

In this scenario, you will learn how to use TensorFlow Core concepts. The content is based on the official [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started).

To take the most of this course, you should know how to program in Python or other languages that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
