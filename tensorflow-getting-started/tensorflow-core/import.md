To start working with Python shell run the following command:

`python`{{execute}}

You can use `quit()` to leave it.

To start working TensorFlow you should first import it to give Python access to all its assets:

`import tensorflow as tf`{{execute}}

Later in a code whenever you want to use TensorFlow classes, methods or symbols you should just refer to `tf` variable.

The core concept of the library (hence the name) are *tensors*. A tensor is an array of any number of dimensions. This data shape is very convenient for a lot of neural networks computations. We will see the examples later in this and future scenarios.
