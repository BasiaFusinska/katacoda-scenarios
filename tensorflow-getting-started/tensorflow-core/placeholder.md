Another structure TensorFlow provides is *placeholder*. Unlike the constants, where you provide the value when defining the node, placeholder is expecting the values when the graph is being evaluated. Let's try to use it for the previous example.

`p1 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)
p2 = tf.placeholder(tf.float32)`{{execute}}

We've just defined two placeholders expecting float values. The adding node can be built using both `add` method or `+` operator.

`add_ph = p1 + p2`{{execute}}

Evaluating the graph that is build with placeholders differs from the one constructed only with constants. For starters it expects the placeholders values in the `feed_dict` parameter. It's a dictionary of placeholders names and corresponding values. You can then run the same graph with different settings.

`print(sess.run(add_ph, {p1: 2, p2: 5}))
print(sess.run(add_ph, {p1: 1.2, p2: 3.5}))
print(sess.run(add_ph, {p1: [1, 2], p2: [5, 8]}))`{{execute}}
