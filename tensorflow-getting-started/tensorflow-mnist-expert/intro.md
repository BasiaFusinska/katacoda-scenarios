This scenario is the continuation of the [MNIST for beginner]() one and shows how to use TensorFlow to build deep convolutional network. The training is performed on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) that is considered a _Hello world_ for the deep learning examples. The content is based on the official [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/pros).

To take the most of this course you should know how to program in Python or other language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
