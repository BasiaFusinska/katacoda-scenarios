This scenario is introduces the high level tf.contrib.learn API for the machine learning process. The training is performed on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) that is considered a _Hello world_ for the deep learning examples. We will walk you through training process, evaluating the model and predicting new values using high level models called Estimators.

To take the most of this course you should know how to program in Python or other language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
