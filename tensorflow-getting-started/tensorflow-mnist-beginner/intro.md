TensorFlow is the platform enabling building deep Neural Network architectures and perform Deep Learning.
This scenario shows how to use TensorFlow to the classification task. the training is performed on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) that is considered a _Hello world_ for the deep learning examples. The content is based on the official [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/mnist/beginners).

To take the most of this course you should know how to program in Python or other language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
