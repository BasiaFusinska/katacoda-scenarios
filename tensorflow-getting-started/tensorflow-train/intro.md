TensorFlow is the platform enabling building deep Neural Network architectures and perform Deep Learning. This scenario you will walk you through the machine learning training process and teach how to use [tf.train API](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/train). The content is based on the official [TensorFlow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/get_started/get_started).

To take the most of this course you should know how to program in Python or other language that would allow you to understand Python syntax.
