TensorFlow is the platform enabling building deep Neural Network architectures and performing Deep Learning. One of the achievements was tackling the challenge for [ImageNet](http://www.image-net.org/), the well known image database.  

This tutorial introduces how to use pretrained model based on [Inception V3](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/inception) architecture to recognise new images.
